# Pixi

This project is no longer being worked on.

Pixi is an experimental social network oriented to multimedia consumption submitted by the user, and general discussion, but focused on raising controversy and discord among users. On Pixi, "Personas" are the first-class citizens. A Persona can post, vote, comment and create channels.
